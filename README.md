# Kali VM Image Builder

Recipes to build Kali Linux Virtual Machine (VM) images.

## Prerequisites

Make sure that the Git repo is cloned locally:

```
apt install git
git clone https://github.com/ungtb10d/kali-vm.git
cd kali-vm/
```

Two build methods are possible: either build straight from your machine, or
build from within a container. Either way, the build actually happens from
within a virtual machine that is created on-the-fly by the build tool
[debos][]. It uses [fakemachine][] under the hood, which in turn relies on
QEMU/KVM.

### Build from the host

If building straight from your machine, you'll need to install `debos` and a
little more:

```
sudo apt install debos p7zip qemu-utils zerofree
```

Then use the script `build.sh` to build an image.

### Build from within a container

If you prefer to build from within a container, you'll need to install either
`podman` or `docker` on your machine.

Then use the script `build-in-container.sh` to build an image.

This script is simply a wrapper on top of `build.sh`, it takes care of creating
the container image if missing, and then it starts a container and performs the
build from within. Both `podman` and `docker` are supported, the script picks
one depending on what's installed on your system.

`podman` has been tested, both as root (eg. `$ sudo ./build-in-container.sh`)
and rootless (eg. `$ ./build-in-container.sh`), it works fine in both cases.

`docker` has not been tested in a while, but it's expected to work.

## Building an image

Use either `build.sh` or `build-in-container.sh`, at your preference. From
this point we'll use `build.sh` for brevity.

### Examples

The best starting point, as always, is the usage message:

```
$ ./build.sh -h
Usage: build.sh [<option>...] [-- <debos option>...]

$
```

Now let's go through some examples:

* `./build.sh`

The command above builds a Kali rolling image, default desktop, default
toolset. This will give you only a raw disk image (ie. a plain binary image of
the disk) and nothing else. It's already a great starting point though: you can
start this disk with QEMU, or you can convert it to another virtual disk format
with `qemu-img convert`.

* `./build.sh -v vmware -b kali-last-snapshot -D gnome`

With the command above, we build a Kali Linux image tailored for VMware. It's
not just a virtual disk, the command also produces various metadata files, so
that the VM can be imported "as is" in VMware. It also comes with the Open VM
Tools pre-installed. Also, with this command we decide to build the image
from the last stable release of Kali, and we install the GNOME desktop
environment, rather than the usual default XFCE.

* `./build.sh -v virtualbox -s 150 -T everything`

With the command above, we build a Kali Linux image tailored for VirtualBox. It
produces the virtual disk and the metadata files so that the VM can be imported
"as is" in VirtualBox, and it comes with the VirtualBox guest utilities
pre-installed. Moreover, we want a 150 GB disk, and we install the "everything"
tool selection (that is, pretty much every tool in Kali).

* `./build.sh -v generic -f ova -D none -T none -P metasploit-framework`

Above, we build a lightweight Kali image: no desktop environment and no default
toolset.  This is a generic image, it comes with support for most VM engines
out there.  We'll export it to the OVA format, suitable for both VMware and
VirtualBox.  Let's also install the package `metasploit-framework`.

* `./build.sh -L $LANG -Z $(cat /etc/timezone) -U $USER:'s3cr3t!p4ssw0rd'`

Above, we build a Kali rolling image, and configure it to mimic the host
system: same locale, same timezone and same username.

### Variants and formats

Different variants of image can be built, depending on what VM engine you want
to run the Kali image in. The VARIANT mostly defines what extra package gets
installed into the image, to add support for a particular VM engine. Then the
FORMAT defines what format for the virtual disk, and what additional metadata
files to produce.

If unset, the format (option `-f`) is automatically set according to the
variant (option `-v`). Not every combination of variant and format make sense,
so the table below tries to summarize the most common combinations.

| variant    | format     | disk format             | metadata | pack |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------------------- | -------- | ---- |
| generic    | raw        |       raw (sparse file) |     none |      |
| generic    | ova        |    streamOptimized VMDK |      OVF |  OVA |
| generic    | ovf        |   monolithicSparse VMDK |      OVF |      |
| qemu       | qemu       |                   QCOW2 |     none |      |
| virtualbox | virtualbox |                     VDI |     VBOX |      |
| vmware     | vmware     | 2GbMaxExtentSparse VMDK |      VMX |      |

The `generic` images come with virtualization support packages pre-installed
for QEMU, VirtualBox and VMware, hence the name "generic". While other images,
that target a specific VM engine, only come with support for this particular
virtualization engine.

Only the format `ova` defines a container: the result of the build is a `.ova`
file, which is simply a tar archive. For other formats, the build produce
separate files. They can be bundled together in a 7z archive with the option
`-z`.

There is also a `rootfs` type: this is not an image. It's simply a Kali Linux
root filesystem tree, without the kernel and the bootloader, and packed in a
`.tar.gz` archive. The main use-case is to reuse it as input to build an OS
image, and it's not meant to be used outside of this build system.

### Additional configuration

You can choose the desktop environment with the `-D` option. You can also
change the default selection of tools included in the image with the `-T`
option.

You can install additional packages with the `-P` option. Either use the option
several times (eg. `-P pkg1 -P pkg2 ...`), or give a comma/space separated
value (eg. `-P "pkg1,pkg2, pkg3 pkg4"`), or a mix of both.

To set the `locale`, use the option `-L`.  Pick a value in the 1st column of
`/usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED`, or check what's configured on your system with
`grep -v ^# /etc/locale.gen`, or simply `echo $LANG`.

To set the `timezone`, use the option `-Z`. Look into `/usr/share/zoneinfo` and
pick a directory and a sub-directory. In doubt, run `tzselect` to guide you, or
look at what's configured on your system with `cat /etc/timezone`.

To set the name and password for the unprivileged user, use the option `-U`.
The value is a single string and the `:` is used to separate the username from
the password.

Pro tip: you can use `-L $LANG -Z $(cat /etc/timezone) -U $USER:$USER` to
configure the image like your own machine.

### Caching proxy configuration

When building OS images, it's useful to have a caching mechanism in place, to
avoid having to download all the packages from Internet, again and again. To
this effect, the build script attempts to detect well-known caching proxies
that would be running on the local host, such as apt-cacher-ng, approx and
squid-deb-proxy.

To override this detection, you can export the variable `http_proxy` yourself.
However, you should remember that the build happens within a QEMU Virtual
Machine, therefore `localhost` in the build environment refers to the VM, not
to the host. If you want to reach the host from the VM, you probably want to
use `http://10.0.2.2`.

For example, if you want to use a proxy that is running on your machine on the
port 9876, use `export http_proxy=10.0.2.2:9876`. If you want to make sure that
no proxy is used, `export http_proxy=`.

Also refer to <https://github.com/go-debos/debos#environment-variables> for
more details.

### Building and reusing a rootfs

It's possible to break the build in two steps. You can first build a rootfs
with `./build.sh -v rootfs`, and then build an image based on this rootfs with
`./build.sh -r ROOTFS_NAME.tar.gz`. It makes sense if you plan to build several
image types, for example.

## Troubleshooting

### Debug a build failure

In order to debug build failures, we need to ask debos to drop us in a "debug
shell" within the VM where the build takes place. This is achieved with the
following command: `./build.sh [...] -- --debug-shell` (more generally, when
you need to pass arguments to debos, you have to list it after `--`, at the end
of the command line).

Once in the VM, you probably want to enter the chroot where the build is taking
place, update the APT cache, and start working:

```
# systemd-nspawn -D /scratch/root`.
Spawning container root on /scratch/root.
Press ^] three times within 1s to kill container.
root@root:~# apt update
```

Having trouble with the console, it needs to be resized? Refer to
<https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2022/04/resizing-consoles-automatically.html>

### Not enough memory

When the scratch area gets full (ie. the `--scratchsize` value is too low), the
build might fail with this kind of error messages:

```
[...]: failed to write (No space left on device)
[...]: Cannot write: No space left on device
```

Solution: bump the value of `--scratchsize`. You can pass arguments to debos
after the special character `--`, so if you need for example 50G, you can do
`./build.sh [...] -- --scratchsize=50G`.
